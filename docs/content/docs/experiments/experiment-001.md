## Question

Can Ariadne prove that changing one persona value influences an observable
output from an authorized Android test application?

## Controlled variable

Two personas will differ in exactly one declared value. The specific value will
be selected with the fixture application so that the expected influence is
known without being hard-coded into Ariadne.

## Procedure

1. Verify the selected emulator, package, and fixture version.
2. Reset the application to a known state.
3. Inject the baseline persona and execute the scripted interaction.
4. Capture authorized network and app-storage observations.
5. Repeat from the same known state with the treatment persona.
6. Normalize declared volatile fields.
7. Compare observations and generate an evidence bundle.

## Success criteria

- One expected persona-dependent difference is reported.
- Known timestamp or identifier noise is not reported as causal.
- Every finding links to raw evidence.
- Capture gaps appear as unknowns.
- A new contributor can reproduce the result.

## Non-goals

- Testing third-party applications without authorization
- Defeating certificate pinning
- Running a general-purpose Android malware sandbox
- Supporting multiple capture backends before the first experiment works
